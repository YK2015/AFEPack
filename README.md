# AFEPack

It is a lightweight version of AFEPack (Adaptive Finite Element Package), 
which is developed by Prof. Ruo Li. AFEPack is a C++ library providing 
very flexible data structure to develop the finite element and handle 
the mesh adaptive. 

Here this AFEPack is decoupled from the package deal.II, only Boost and MPI and
C++11 features are required for the installation. 

Specify the compiler in Makefile.1 and do a "make". So much lightweight, hah ^^
