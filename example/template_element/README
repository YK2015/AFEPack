This example will build a stiff matrix of Laplacian operator on a mesh
including triangles and rectangles. The sparsity pattern of the obtained
stiff matrix is saved in a "gnuplot" file.

Usage:
	1. compile with make [-e debug=no];
	2. run with ./run;
	3. view the obtained sparsity pattern with gnuplot;
